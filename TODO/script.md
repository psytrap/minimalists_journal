Lets get started!

Start with your monthly goals on the first page of your monthly journal

For the week you can use the weekly planner for the rough planning and the details follow on a daily basis there as well

The bullet pages are for the notes that collect all your thoughts.
These collections are all sorts of things: TODO lists, wish
lists favorites lists, ideas / concepts, goals & plans,
analysis, self-knowledge & reflections ...

For quick notes you better keep your usual notepad.

At the end of your monthly you do your monthly log.
You might carry over some of your collections to the next Monthly Journal, archive them in the Annual Journal or dipose them.
Do what ever suits best.

== Annual Journal

Contains
