# The Minimalists Bullet Journal


Bullet Journaling helps to organize your life and clean-up your mind. It helps you to see the past, the present and the future clearly and this way strengthen your focus on what to do now. The Minimalists Bullet Journal has a simple structure and is easy to use. Therefor it creates strong benfits with little burden. It doesn't look nice unless you enforce it, but minimal looks good on its own.

Here you'll find instructions and templates to create a clean and useful bullet journal with minimal effort.

# TL;DR
The Minimalists Bullet Journal splits into a monthly and an annual journal. The monthly journal contains everything about current activites and divides into a weekly planner section and a section for note making. It's small and even fits below the keyboard on your desk or into your bag. The annual journal contains everything long-term like plans, calendars, goals or reflections. 

Since the proposed journal requires a few tools there's also a beginner version of the journal to get started.
